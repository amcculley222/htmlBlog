            blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is an informational website
            published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often
            informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically
            displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent
            post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs
            were usually the work of a single individual,[citation needed]
            occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or
            topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring
            the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited.
            MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think
            tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an
            increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other
            "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs
            into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to
            maintain or add content to a blog.

            any blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic,
            ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics,
            and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or
            online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A
            typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other
            blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs
            are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs),
            photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or "vlogs"), music
            (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In education, blogs can be used
            as instructional resources; these are referred to as edublogs.
            Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short
            posts. 'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content
            creation and sharing on social media, especially when the content is
            long-form and one creates and shares content on regular basis. So,
            one could be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on
            Instagram.
